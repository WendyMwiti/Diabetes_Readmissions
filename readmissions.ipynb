    "## Cracking the Code on the Readmission causes of patient's with Diabetes\n",
    "Unplanned hospital readmissions impose a substantial financial burden of approximately $15-20 billion annually on healthcare providers in the United States. By mitigating readmission rates among patients with diabetes, there is a twofold potential: improvement of healthcare systems and enhancing the overall well-being of patients. Precise management of blood sugar levels in individuals with diabetes yields a noteworthy decrease in both mortality and morbidity rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis aims to scrutinize historical trends in diabetes care for patients hospitalized in the US, subsequently guiding the formulation of medical protocols for superior patient care. Within this investigation, particular emphasis is placed on the significance of the HbA1c marker in managing diabetes mellitus patients. The hypothesis asserts that the measurement of HbA1c is intrinsically linked to  reduction in readmission rates for individuals undergoing hospitalization."
